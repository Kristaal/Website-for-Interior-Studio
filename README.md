## Design

### Design Choices
The web site was designed keeping in mind that the visitor should see a modern expensive site with unique elements and examples of design studio projects. Attractive website gives an idea of the combination of textures, colors, art and engineering.
Images are selected according to the color scheme.

### Colour
For the color scheme, gray and green tones were chosen to match the images on the page, as well as the color scheme of the design studio itself.These colors give an idea of modern, high cost and green gives a fresh look.
<br>

### Fonts
Poppins font was chosen for the entire website. It is one of the Geometric sans serif typefaces, that is very popular for building websites. Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections.

### Structure
The page is structured in a well recognizable, user friendly and easy to learn way. Upon arriving to the website the user sees a familiar type of navigation bar with the studio's logo on the left side and the navigation links to the right. 
The website consists of four separate pages: 
- A homepage with with social media accounts of design studio and button to make request;
